        \begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Agglomeration economies}: efficiency gains from density of economic activity
				\item These gains impact both firms and workers
				\item Literature has identified that \textbf{workers in larger cities earn higher wages}
				\item My research seeks to improve the understanding for why this occurs

				\item \textbf{Quantify competing explanations for city size wage premium:}

				\item Sorting on observed and unobserved skill
				\item Compensating differentials for locational amenities

      \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        \begin{itemize}
				\item There is a sizable, monotonic city size wage premium that persists even after controlling for cost of living and a variety of human capital and local productivity measures
				\item The structural model appropriately treats selection of skilled workers into cities
				\item Simulations of the model will reveal the relative importance of each of the sources contributing to the wage premium
